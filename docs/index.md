## Welcome

This is a place where I'll write down some of the things I've learned to help others save some time and energy.

## Discussions

- [Benchmarking Python Serializers](python_serializers.md) - outcome of a little research into the various mechanisms for marshalling Python objects.

## My Projects

[EssentialDB](https://github.com/shane-mason/essentialdb) is a NoSQL document database written in pure Python with similar query syntax to mongo.

[Essential Magic Mirror](https://github.com/shane-mason/essential_magic_mirror) is a hobby project for the raspberry pi.
